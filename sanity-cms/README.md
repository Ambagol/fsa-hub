# Full-Stack Apprentice
Your practical route as a self-taught software developer.

# Why?

We believe in creating a world where most people have work that is fulfilling, and where they can earn the living they need to build the future they envision for themselves and their family.

If you can think logically, you can harness the power of a computer. In the 21st century, your body is no longer your most valuable asset - it is your mind.

Learning to manipulate a computer will empower your beyond what you currently think is possible. New worlds will open up to you, and your potential to earn money & create investment income for yourself will increase exponentially.

With a computer, you hold infinite power - to create anything from nothing.

# How?

Through the ages, humanity has passed down knowledge through apprenticeships.

Blacksmiths, welders and engineers managed apprenticeships for hundreds of years. Before he sat on the $100 bill, Benjamin Franklin was an apprentice to his brother James as a newspaper printer.

The problem is that we have a critical lack of apprenticeships in the United States. Countries like Germany have harnessed their power to provide their people with a path to a fulfilling career & financial success. Meanwhile, America has 1.4 trillion in student loans and 600,000 unfilled jobs in tech.

# What?

As a JavaScript Apprentice, you will learn how to harness the most versatile programming language ever. You will work with a mentor, a teacher who will pass on their skills. In exchange for their knowledge & direction, you will gain practical career experience by helping them achieve success with their entrepreneurial ventures.

You will learn how to set up your development environment, and the basics of how your computer works. You will learn the basics of web and application design, following tutorials & online walkthroughs. You will create projects that demonstrate knowledge of the following skill areas:

  - Authenticating & Authorizing Users (Login, Register)
  - Interface Design, & User Experience Principles
  - Setting up API's on a JavaScript server with Express.js
  - Querying, updating & sanitizing PostgreSQL databases
  - Component-drive applications with React.js & Redux
  - Amazon Web Services for your infrastructure needs
  - Writing automated tests using Jest

After you & your mentor believe you are ready, you will set out to build a full-stack application purely for yourself - to demonstrate your emerging competence in the field. It can be entrepreneurial or activist in nature, but above all it must be useful.

After completion, you may search for a job or freelance. You will have finished your apprenticeship, & continue your journey.
